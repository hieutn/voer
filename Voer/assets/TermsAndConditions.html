        <h3>IBM Approved Personal Device Terms-n-Conditions</h3>
        <h4>Please review and accept IAPD (IBM BYOD) Terms and Conditions</h4>
        
        <ul style="padding-left:15px;list-style: disc;">
            <li>Employee must obtain permission from their first-line manager to use a personally owned device for IBM business.</li>
            <li>Employee must adhere to IBM ITCS300 which requires security measures such as configuration of device passcodes and screen saver locks, installation of anti-virus/malware detection software, and enablement of approved device/data encryption capabilities. If Sensitive Personal Information is to be stored or accessed on devices, encryption must be enabled.</li>
            <li>In adherence to IBM ITCS300 section 2.3.3, IBM information is not to be stored, copied, or forwarded to a public service or your Internet service provider's email, calendar or storage space. This restriction applies to public cloud services providing online storage and file sharing capabilities.</li>
            <li>For the purposes of these Terms and Conditions, any information and data, regardless of source, that is in the possession, custody, or control of an Employee in the course of performing responsibilities for IBM is owned by IBM and is the property of IBM (i.e. “IBM Property”). This includes any IBM information and data that is maintained or stored on any personally owned electronic computing or storage device, including but not limited to desktops, laptops, tablets and smartphones.</li>
            <li>Employee must abide by IBM’s Business Conduct Guidelines while using personal devices for work. Employees who fail to follow the Business Conduct Guidelines regarding their use of personal assets may be subject to disciplinary action.</li>
            <li>Employee must permit IBM, or any third party legally mandated, to inspect or take possession of the device upon request by IBM. IBM will make a good faith effort to avoid inspecting any personal information maintained or stored on the device. If an inspection results in the unintentional review or retrieval of personal information, any personal information will be handled in accordance with IBM’s privacy policy.</li>
            <li>BM may require the installation of an agent on the device for Employees using personally owned devices for IBM business. If this is required, IBM will supply the agent and inform Employees of the need to install the agent. The purpose of the agent includes, but is not limited to, ensuring proper security controls and linkage of the device to IBM systems.</li>
            <li>IBM can revoke the ability of Employee to use his or her personal device for work at any time.</li>
            <li>Upon separation from IBM, or if Employee decides to no longer use the personal device for IBM business purposes, Employee must return all IBM Property as defined within these Terms and Conditions, without retaining a copy on any personal device.</li>
            <li>Upon request by IBM, and if Employee is subject to a litigation Document Retention Order (DRO), Employee must return all IBM Property, without retaining a copy on any personal device.</li>
            <li>Upon request by IBM, all IBM Property must be removed from the device when it is no longer used for IBM business. Employee must permit IBM to wipe or erase all IBM Property from any personal device used for work at any time. If any legal retention requirements apply, they must be met prior to removal of any data.</li>
            <li>IBM is not obligated to provide (or give access to) any third-party software, accessories or other items for an Employee's personally owned devices. With respect to third-party software, IBM will only provide that to an Employee with management approval, subject to IBM's expense guidelines, and provided the Employee obtains those items through approved IBM procurement processes. An Employee may use items provided by IBM only for IBM business purposes and incidental personal use. If an Employee decides to acquire software, accessories, or other items on their own for their personally owned device, without IBM reimbursement, and to use them for IBM business purposes, the Employee must be sure to obtain valid licenses for those items and to assure themselves that the licenses will permit the Employee to use the items for business purposes. IBM is not responsible for those licenses or the Employee's compliance with them.</li>
            <li>IBM will provide IBM-authored software applications required to perform the Employee's job role for use on a personal device for business purposes.</li>
            <li>If a device that Employee is using for work is lost or stolen, Employee must report the incident using the Security Incident Reporting process.</li>
            <li>Employee must not provide access to or share the storage, network, or data of the device used for IBM business with another party for any public or private use (“file sharing”).</li>
            <li>To the extent permitted by law, IBM may pursue legal remedies, including injunctive relief, to enforce the terms and conditions set forth above.</li>
        </ul>
